    <p class="highcharts-description">
        The pie chart above shows the percentage of strategies used by players by per group, i.e Both players Cooperated,
        Both players Defected, or Both Cooperated and Defected.

    <p class="highcharts-description">
        Conclusion:
        We can see that rational beings' behaviour cannot easily be predicted in non-zero sum games.
    </p>

    <p class="highcharts-description">
        Question 1:
        Did communication with your group member help you when making your choice/ deciding your strategy? Was the other
        player honest - were their actions correlated to what was decided upon in your chart?

        This is known as a cooperative non zero-sum game.

    <p class="highcharts-description">
        The graph above show the different decisions made by players per group, and the pay off earned per player.
        <br>
        <br>
        <span style="color:#ff4000;">Red</span> indicates <b> defection</b>.
        <br>
        <span style="color:#00bfff;">Blue</span> indicates <b> cooperation</b>.
    </p>

    <p class="highcharts-description">
        Question 2:
        If you repeated the game with another randomly assigned player, would you change your strategy?
        Would it be different if you repeated the game with the same player you played with in the first round?
    </p>

    <p class="highcharts-description">
        Question 3:
        Do you think that rational humans in general are more likely to defect, or cooperate? Think of a real life situation.
        Relate this to evolution in biology too, and see which strategy is most used by living organisms to survive.
