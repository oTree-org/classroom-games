            Instructions

        <p>
            You have been randomly and anonymously paired with another participant.
            One of you will be selected at random to be participant A;
            the other will be participant B.
            You will learn whether you are participant A or B prior to making any
            decision.
        </p>
        <p>
            To start, participant A receives {{ Constants.endowment }};
            participant B receives nothing.
            Participant A can <b>offer</b> none, some or all of
            their {{ Constants.endowment }} to participant B.
        </p>
        <p>Participant B can then chose to <b>Accept</b> or <b>Reject</b> the offer.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If B accepts the offer, B receives the amount offered by A and A receives
                what is left after subtracting the offer from {{ Constants.endowment }}
            </li>
            <li>If B rejects the offer, both A and B receive {{ Constants.reject_payoff }}</li>
        </ul>
